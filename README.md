## A few notes about this app
- My main goal for this small project was to learn TypeScript in combination with React.js and to be honest I've learned a lot of stuff. (inspired by a tutorial from free code camp youtube channel)
- About the styling, it definitely can be improved. Feel free to clone this repo and have fun with the code.
- When it comes to TypeScript, I did my best to keep the code clean so that anyone who takes a look inside this project can understand it.

### I encourage you to clone this project and get your hands dirty with some TypeScript and React. This is a nice combination that I'm starting to love more and more.
